# Main-Method-Assignment
Explanation of Code (Comments):

Each method in MathOperations is designed to handle a different data type (int, decimal, and string), applying a distinct mathematical operation.
In Main(), we instantiate MathOperations and call each overloaded method, displaying each result to the user.
Comments are added to explain each section of the code so that other developers can understand the flow and purpose of each method.
